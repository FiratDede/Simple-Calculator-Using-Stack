# Simple-Calculator-Using-Stack
I developed this program for Cmpe242 course homework. This program is a simple  calculator which supports  +, -, *, /, and %. operators and integer operands.
• The user enters input that consisting of operands and operators, presumably in post-fix notation.
• If the user enters a valid integer, you push that integer onto the stack.
• If the user enters a valid operator, you pop two integers off the stack, perform the requested operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
• If the user enters the S as an input, you print the current state of the stack.
• If the user enters the P as an input, you pop the top element off the stack and print only that element (not the entire stack) followed by a new line.
• If the user enters the E, you exit the program.
