# Simple-Calculator-Using-Stack
I developed this program for Cmpe242 course homework. This program is a simple  calculator which supports  +, -, *, /, and %. operators and integer operands. This calculator uses stack data structure. Input must be in post-fix notation. </br>
### Some constraints:
1)The user enters input that consisting of operands and operators, presumably in post-fix notation.
2)This calculator just support integer values. So input operands must be integers.
### Some commands:

1) If user enters S as an input. the user see current state of the stack.
2) If user enters P as an input, pop operation is performed in calculator. Also the user sees popped element
3)If the user enters the E, the user exits the program.
